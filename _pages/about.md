I am an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Washington. My research is focused on 
      1) building evidence on the role of diets for cardiovascular disease prevention, 
      2) identifying metabolic and biologic pathways that are modifiable by healthy diets, and 
      3) uncovering early biomarkers and therapeutic targets of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. Dr. Kim uses high
      throughput omics data (metabolomics, proteomics, epigenetics) from feeding studies and large observational studies in her
      research.
